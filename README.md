# My C Practices
This repository holds a collection of my exercises and projects completed in the C programming language. As a Computer Engineering student, I use this space to store, organize, and showcase my progress and learning in C.

# Content
Within this repository, you'll find:

- **Fundamental Exercises:** Simple programs exploring basic C concepts like data types, operators, control structures (conditionals and loops), and functions.
- **Basic Data Structures:** Implementations of structures such as arrays, pointers, character strings, and user-defined structures (struct).
- **File Handling:** Examples of reading from and writing data to files.
- **Small Projects:** Implementations of slightly more complex programs that integrate various concepts.

# Purpose
The main goals of this repository are to:

- **Track Learning:** Keep a record of covered topics and acquired skills in C.
- **Quick Reference:** Serve as a place to review implementations of specific concepts when needed.
- **Code Portfolio:** Showcase my familiarity with the C language to future collaborators or employers.

# How to Use?
In this repository, the 00-practice file serves as a comprehensive list of all exercises and a brief description of what each one entails. All other files contain the actual exercise implementations.
